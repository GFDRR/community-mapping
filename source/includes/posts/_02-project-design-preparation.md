# Project design and preparation

## Key Partnerships

Involvement of a wide community of partners is a central component of an Open Cities mapping project. The OSM community is already built around the idea of collaboration, and its mapping software serves this purpose. Open Cities project data are sourced from and collected by many users and partners and are open and freely available to anyone who wants to use the data. Thus, engaging a community of users and contributors is an important  rst objective of planning a mapping project.

<b>Consider that a good partner</b>
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Is already undertaking work in a similar context;</li>
        <li>Needs the data being collected in its operation;</li>
        <li>Has a passion for change and an openness to innovation;</li>
        <li>Will benefit from the innovation to improve its workf low;</li>
        <li>Provides contextual knowledge; and</li>
        <li>Shares resources such as workspace, relationships,
staff, and supplies.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### Why Would Groups Join an Open Cities Project?

All organizations involved in disaster risk management and urban planning (such as local and national govern- ments, international partners, and nongovernmental organizations [NGOs]) need up-to-date, detailed data for their operations. Some of them may already be strug- gling to maintain their own datasets. By joining with many partners, organizations  nd it easier to keep data relevant and up-to-date and to avoid reinventing the wheel. The data become more useful and more widely used, their application leading to greater innovation,which in turn encourages further collection of valuable data, which feed back into a robust open data ecosystem.

### Outreach

Government support and participation in an Open Cities mapping project is a key strategy for ensuring its sustainability. The OSM community is also a essential resource, along with other partners such as universities, civil society organizations, and the private sector. This subsection examines these likely partners and their potential roles.

#### Government

In most contexts, governmental support will bene t a mapping initiative because different government units can provide resources and ensure better sustainability and legitimacy of the work. Therefore, they should be included as partners from the early stages of planning.

Government entities will bene t from access to up-to-date, detailed data that they already devote great resources to maintain. In the long-term, government can incorporate the Open Cities data collection methodology into national initiatives by sharing data, experience, and resources. This sort of buy-in will strengthen the project over time. In turn, government support can aid your project in terms of planning, legitimacy, access to exist- ing data, and provision of local resources. Government, particularly the national and local agencies that already work in mapping and geographic data, can provide valu- able insight concerning how to plan mapping activities ef ciently. Their involvement also adds legitimacy. For example, mappers may face challenges from local people when surveying an area. With the engagement of local government or other authorities, mappers may carry ID cards or letters of approval to demonstrate of cial support for the project during data collection in the field.

Finally, useful existing data may be found in govern- ment storage. Although convincing government bodies to release their data freely to the public can be a chal- lenge (or some data may be private or sensitive), much
of the data will be more useful if opened for public access. Furthermore, if the information collected during the project can enhance and build upon government data, the government will bene t through the return of updated datasets. Open Cities can also be an entry point for the government to increase its capacities, update employees’ skills, and start integrating innovative tools and methods into its work ow to reduce costs and improve regular operations.

Many different levels and parts of the government can be approached, depending on the focus of the project. When starting a project, identify those agencies that are most important to approach for support. Relevant government departments may cover the following areas:

<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Urban development</li>
        <li>Disaster management</li>
        <li>Mapping or surveying</li>
        <li>Census and statistics</li>
        <li>Information and communication technology</li>
        <li>Transportation</li>
        <li>Water and sanitation</li>
        <li>Local government (such as regional and municipal governments, village heads)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

#### OpenStreetMap Community

Because Open Cities mapping is built upon the OSM platform, another group to communicate with is the existing OSM community. It is important to understand what the mapping community already looks like and how the Open Cities Project might best support and work with this existing group.

What is the OSM community? Simply put, anyone who actively contributes to OpenStreetMap in a given country or region is part of that community. In active communi- ties, mappers communicate with each other often, plan mapping events, and collaborate on OSM development. In quieter communities, mappers communicate less but contribute for their own personal reasons. Active, vibrant communities are the most productive and sustainable, but no matter what the local OSM user base looks like, there are always possibilities to engage.

Even if direct partnership is not developed with existing OSM contributors, it is important to maintain commu- nication with them and inform them of the project goals and target areas. Since Open Cities mapping will likely take place in an area where others have already mapped, the project must not overwrite the information already entered by volunteer mappers who used local knowledge to edit the map. It is critical that the project participants, as a volunteer community, coordinate any large data imports with the existing community and respects work that has already been accurately completed.

There are several ways to get in touch with OSM mappers:

<ul>
    <li>E-mail lists. In many countries, the mappers commu- nicate through dedicated e-mail lists. You can find such lists at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo">lists.openstreetmap.org</a>.</li>
    <li>Facebook. In some places, the OSM communities have chosen to communicate using Facebook groups. Therefore, you should search Facebook to find out whether there is a local group for OSM contributors in the areas you plan to map.</li>
    <li>Wiki pages or sites. It is important to check the status of mapping in certain areas by visiting the OSM Wiki site, starting with the main page at <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.open-streetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://wiki.open-streetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>. Most countries have at least one dedicated page to the status of the project.</li>
    <li>The “Neis One!” blog. Another useful starting point for connecting with the OSM community is Pascal Neis’s blog at <a href="http://neis-one.org">neis-one.org</a>, which provides tools that show which users are actively mapping in certain areas.</li>
</ul>

#### Other Groups

Other groups may also be considered potential collab- orators. Table 2.1 describes several sources of potential partners.

Building partnerships is essential to reaching the high- er-level goals of an Open Cities mapping project, such as strengthening the open-source mapping community. Ideally your partners will be directly involved in the planning and implementation of the project. However, if key partners cannot commit time and resources, it is still important to keep them informed about project activities. In this way, you can keep them connected and approach them again later as your project expands.

## Defining the scope of work

The first step of Open Cities project planning is to clearly de ne the objectives. This means answering questions such as these:

<ul>
    <li>What is the scale of the project? Has this been done here before?</li>
    <li>What will the data be used for?</li>
    <li>What data will we collect?</li>
    <li>What geographic area will we cover?</li>
    <li>What is the time frame for project completion?</li>
</ul>

### Overview of the Process

Defining your project’s scope means considering how much area will be mapped, how much data will be collected, and how much time the project will require—a process illustrated in figure 2.2. These decisions will enable you to determine your personnel and resource requirements as well.

Although your long-term objective might be to map a large area such as a city, district, or even a country, it
is advisable to begin with a smaller pilot project (box 2.1) and later scale up. This provides the necessary time and experience to build capacity in your team, nurture partnerships, and gain experience in the process.

The following sections will explain how to de ne the target area and make rough estimates of the number
of features to be mapped. We will discuss what a data model is, how it should be de ned, and how to engage partners in this process. Last, we will consider how to manage a project’s time frame and ensure that tasks are properly done in succession, so that your project effec- tively meets its deadlines and its goals.

<div class="c-box">
<span class="box-title">Box 2.1 Pilot Projects</span>
  <p>Pilot projects typically map a small part of a much larger area, over a short time frame. The goals of pilot projects are not only to collect data but also to experiment with the surveying methodology and determine the most effective and efficient ways of mapping. Such projects are also useful for demonstrating the effectiveness of innovative mapping tools and strengthening local support.</p>

### Why Are You Collecting the Data?

One of the first questions in designing a project is simply, “What will the data be used for?” In other words,
why are you collecting data? You should have a good answer for this at the outset because it will define the
sort of data that you want to collect. 

For example, Open Cities projects are often oriented toward disaster risk reduction. In the case of disaster preparedness, this might mean collecting data about buildings and other critical infrastructure. For starters, the data would include the location of each building and its geometry (the building’s footprint on the ground), but it also includes information about other building attributes such as the number of levels in the building, the shape of the roof, and the materials used for the walls.

To determine which types of features and attributes the project should map, you will want to consult with the partners involved in the project. For example, you may be working closely with the government’s water and sanitation department—and they might not need buildings’ structural characteristics but will be very interested in using data about drainage lines and solid waste.

One potential challenge is that, with numerous partners wanting different information, you may end up with requests to map many different features along with a wide range of attributes for each. Such a large data model may not be practical to map with the resources at your disposal. Increasing the number of attributes collected has, in previous projects, decreased both the quantity of features mapped as well as the quality of the data. It is therefore important to limit the amount of collected information to only the most important features and attributes. Keeping things as simple as possible will help ensure project success, particularly in pilot projects. 

### Defining the Target Area

You should precisely determine your intended survey area from the start. Are you mapping an entire city? Part of a city? An arbitrary area?

Let’s say that you are mapping a city. You may simply think, “We are mapping City X. That is the area, and it has been defined.” But what does that mean? Does that mean the official government boundaries of City X? Are we interested in the entire urban area or only the city center? If the target area coincides with an existing administrative division, the area will be easy to define, though it might not follow natural roads and features as well as you might like.

Finally, it will benefit you a great deal to know as much as you can about your target area from the beginning. Think about questions such as these:

<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>How large is the target area in square kilometers?</li>
        <li>How many people live there?</li>
        <li>How many buildings and roads are in the area?</li>
        <li>What will be the main challenges of mapping this area?</li>
    </ul>
</div>
