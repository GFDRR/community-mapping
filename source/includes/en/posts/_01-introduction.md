# Introduction

## 1.1 History of open cities and the open data for Resilience Initiative

The World Bank, through its Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), launched the Open Cities Project in November 2012 to create open data ecosystems that will facilitate innovative, data-driven urban planning and disaster risk management in South Asian cities. Open Cities is one component of a broader World Bank and GFDRR program, the Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI), further described in box 1.1.

  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 1.1 About OpenDRI</b></span>
  <p>Open Cities is part of the Open Data for Resilience Initiative, sponsored by the World Bank and GFDRR. OpenDRI brings the philosophies and practices of the open data movement to bear on the challenges of building resilience to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. In partner- ship with governments, international organizations, and civil society groups, this initiative develops open systems for creating, sharing, and using disaster risk and climate change information to ensure that a wide range of actors can participate in meeting these challenges. Since its launch in 2011, OpenDRI has worked to implement these ideas in over 25 countries around the world.</p>

Since its inception, Open Cities has brought together stakeholders from government, donor agencies, the private sector, universities, and civil society groups to create usable information through community mapping techniques, to build applications and tools that inform decision making, and to develop the networks of trust and social capital necessary for these efforts to become sustainable. This process has been evolutionary, with opportunities for experimentation, learning, failure, and adaptation incorporated into the project planning. This guide discusses the rationale and design of the Open Cities Project, the major components of its implementa- tion to date, and some of the most salient lessons learned from the project so far.

The Open Cities Project launched its efforts in three cities: Batticaloa, Sri Lanka; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Kathmandu, Nepal. These cities were chosen for
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Their high levels of disaster risk;</li>
        <li>The presence of World Bank-lending activities related to urban planning and disaster management that would benefit from access to better data; and</li>
        <li>The willingness of government counterparts to partic- ipate in and help guide the interventions.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

In each of these projects, Open Cities has supported the creation of new data while also attending to the cities’ broader ecosystems of open data production and use. To view the city-specific project data collected thus far, visit the Open Cities website (box 1.2).

  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 1.2 The Open Cities Website</b></span>
  <p>The Open Cities website provides case studies and visualizations of, and access to, much of the data collected during the first round of Open Cities projects. It was designed and built by our partners at Development Seed and can be accessed at
  <a href="http://opencitiesproject.org" target="_blank">opencitiesproject.org</a>. It will be updated continually as the program expands and more data become available.</p>

Leveraging robust, accurate data to improve urban planning and disaster risk management decisions requires not only high-quality information but also the requisite tools, skills, and willingness to commit to a data-driven decision-making process. With this in mind, Open Cities also has developed partnerships across government ministries, donor agencies, universities, private sector technology groups, and civil society organizations to ensure broad acceptance of the data produced, facilitate data use, and align investments across projects and sectors.


## 1.2 Rationale for the Open Cities Project

South Asia is one of the most rapidly urbanizing regions in the world. A deep understanding of the built environ- ment is critical to providing relevant services, managing urban growth, and visualizing disaster risk in this context. For example, good characterization of the built environment allows urban planners, engineers, and policy makers to plan for and design appropriate trans- portation systems and adequate water supply systems; to estimate the population distribution of cities; attempt to manage urban sprawl; and to identify potential sites for parks and public services. In addition, growing popu- lations, unplanned settlements, and unsafe building practices all increase disaster risk.

As urban populations and vulnerability grow, manag- ing urban growth in a way that fosters cities’ resilience to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change becomes an ever-greater challenge that requires detailed, up-to-date geographic data of the built environment.

To meet this challenge requires innovative, affordable, precise, open, and dynamic data collection and mapping processes that support management of urban growth and disaster risk. In response to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, OpenStreetMap pioneered such efforts, as box 1.3 further describes.

<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 1.3 OpenStreetMap</b></span>
  <p>Open Cities drew from, and was inspired by, a number of projects involving community mapping, primarily the OpenStreetMap (OSM) response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the “Community Mapping for Exposure” effort by Australian and Indonesian governments with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). Open Cities and the other projects used the OSM platform to harness the power of crowd and community to create accurate, up-to-date spatial data about locations and characteristics of the built and natural environments. Dubbed “the Wikipedia of maps” by its founder, British technology entrepreneur Steve Coast, OSM is an online database and a global com- munity of over 1 million contributors who collaborate toward building a free and open map of the world to which anyone can contribute and which anyone can use in their own tools and analysis.</p>

<p>OSM was first used in disaster response in a large-scale fashion in Haiti, following the January 12, 2010, earthquake. In the days following the disaster, the World Bank, Google, and several other entities made high-resolution imagery of the affected area available to the public. Over 600 individuals from the global OSM community began digitizing the imagery and tracing roads, building footprints, and other infrastructure, creating what quickly became the most detailed map of Port au Prince in existence. OSM’s map became the de facto map for the area, and it was used on the global positioning system (GPS) devices of search and rescue teams, to help route supplies around the congested and devastated capital, and to coordinate many other aspects of the response and reconstruction effort. Subsequent work supported by the World Bank, the International Organi- zation for Migration (IOM), USAID, and others would go on to help develop an OSM community in Haiti, ensuring local contributors would continue to shepherd and maintain the resource that international volunteers had created.</p>

<p>The experience of OSM Haiti demonstrated that volunteers who collaborated around open data could quickly create accurate and trusted information. Meanwhile, an OSM project in Indonesia called “Community Mapping for Exposure” has sought to create data—locally and in advance of a disaster—that could inform disaster preparedness and contingency planning activities. Working with local governments, university students, and civil society groups, the mapping work has focused especially on critical infrastructure in the capital region of Jakarta, including schools, hospitals, community centers, and places of worship. The resulting data have been combined with hazard information from a variety of sources to produce realistic impact scenarios using the InaSAFE tool. InaSAFE is an open-source project developed by the Australian Government, the Government of Indonesia, and the World Bank that was created specifically for this work but is now being deployed in other DRM projects. The OSM project has since expanded beyond Jakarta and has mapped over 1 million buildings across Indonesia since March 2011.</p>

Open Cities approaches risk assessment differently from catastrophic-risk-modeling firms, whose data are typically used either for broad awareness raising or for the insurance industry. These professional assess- ments often involve computationally intensive mod- eling analysis, but they also tend to rely on statistical representations, proxies, or estimations of the exposed assets, which are expressed in monetary terms. Such data are insufficient for driving specific investments to reduce disaster risk because they typically do not locate, describe, and value individual assets.

By contrast, Open Cities engages local expertise and stakeholders in identifying all building structures in an area and assigning vulnerability attributes to each through community mapping and crowdsourcing. In this way, a risk assessment that identifies particular at-risk structures can be completed. An assessment this precise can identify structures based on importance and risk level and therefore can guide plans to reduce disas- ter and climate risk through physical investment.

Moreover, Open Cities uses detailed information about roads, building infrastructures, and population to help develop land use plans, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and plans for cash transfers to affected vulner- able households in an informed and effective manner. Open Cities thus provides the platform to support activities through the entire disaster risk management cycle. The concept has proven effective and, in fact, can be less expensive to complete than the exposure and vulnerability analyses by typical risk modelers, thanks to the engagement of local experts and stakeholders. It also helps to ensure ownership of, and trust in, the data by the local stakeholders and community.

As the data collected become openly accessible, they can be reused, complemented, and enhanced for other appli- cations beyond the initial project, especially in sectors such as energy and transportation where detailed, up-to- date geographic data are required to develop investment programs. As such, having dynamic and detailed data that are freely available to and enhanced by all sectors of the government, development institutions, and private business creates economic value far beyond the project that initiates the data collection. (Box 1.4 describes the open license for availability and use of the data in con- junction with the OpenStreetMap platform.)

<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 1.4 Open Data Licensing</b></span>
  <p>The information collected and added to the OpenStreetMap platform is distributed with the Open Database License (ODbL). This means that although individual contributors hold the copyright to the data they produce, the collective data of all contributors are available under this open license. The ODbL allows anyone to freely copy, distribute, and adapt OSM data. The only requirement is that OSM be given credit in any adapted works, and if the original data are altered, the result should be made available under the same license.</p>
</div>

In addition to the value of the data’s sheer availability, the Open Cities Project’s approach of building the capacity of local communities, local and national gov- ernment, academics, and the private sector creates social and human capital, jobs, support to innovation and new business while ensuring that the overall efforts become sustainable. An integral part of Open Cities as a com- ponent of OpenDRI is the development of an ecosystem of data producers and data users through partnerships, capacity building, innovation, and software develop- ment—aspects to be further described throughout the guide.

Open Cities has achieved several noteworthy outcomes during its first year:
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive and accessible databases of the built environment. For instance, Batticaloa now has a detailed structural database of every building, and Kathmandu has a database of all schools and hospitals to use for risk assessment.</li>
        <li>Improved in-country capacity to update, maintain, and use key datasets. For instance, Kathmandu has created innovation spaces such as the Kathmandu Living Labs, internship opportunities, and university curricula that provide students with employable skills.</li>
        <li>Mainstreamed open-data use and strengthened data collection and management processes at different levels of government. For instance, the Sri Lanka Survey Department asked for support to start incor- porating crowdsourcing and community mapping approaches into its regular workflow, and the Govern- ment of Sri Lanka sought support for the creation of an Open and Spatial Data Infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Adoption of new applications by multiple levels of government and Bank-financed projects. For instance, forthcoming risk assessments will be driven by detailed data to design physical mitigation investment programs.</li>
        <li>Complementary new partnerships and increased collaboration. New partners to implement projects include the U.S. Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), and the American Red Cross.</li>
    </ul>

## 1.3 How to Use this Guide

This guide offers a comprehensive understanding of the design and implementation of an Open Cities mapping project—for both practitioners in the field and those interested in a higher-level understanding of the process. The guide’s content is based on experience in imple- menting the initial Open Cities projects in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka as well as on previous mapping project experience. Where relevant, it provides relevant examples from those projects in the text and full case studies at the end of guide.

Figure 1.1 depicts the overall process that the chapters will discuss in detail. The next chapter, “Project Design and Preparation,” covers how a project design process begins: by identifying partners, clarifying a project’s objectives and scope, assembling a team of managers and mappers, and assessing the necessary resources for mapping. Chapter 3, “Getting Started,” then describes the steps after the initial planning stage: how to locate an appropriate workspace, assess equipment costs, and prepare staff training. Chapter 4, “Implementation and Supervision,” takes a practical look at data collection techniques from both the organizational and technical perspectives. It also addresses common challenges and mechanisms for quality control and reporting. Finally, chapter 5 examines the lessons learned from previous Open Cities projects and considers future improvements to the overall project design.
