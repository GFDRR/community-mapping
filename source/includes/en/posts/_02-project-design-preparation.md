# Project design and preparation

## 2.1 Key Partnerships

Involvement of a wide community of partners is a central component of an Open Cities mapping project. The OSM community is already built around the idea of collaboration, and its mapping software serves this purpose. Open Cities project data are sourced from and collected by many users and partners and are open and freely available to anyone who wants to use the data. Thus, engaging a community of users and contributors is an important first objective of planning a mapping project.

<p><b>A good partner...</b></p>
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Is already undertaking work in a similar context;</li>
        <li>Needs the data being collected in its operation;</li>
        <li>Has a passion for change and an openness to innovation;</li>
        <li>Will benefit from the innovation to improve its workflow;</li>
        <li>Provides contextual knowledge; and</li>
        <li>Shares resources such as workspace, relationships,staff, and supplies.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### 2.1.1 Why Would Groups Join an Open Cities Project?

All organizations involved in disaster risk management and urban planning (such as local and national governments, international partners, and nongovernmental organizations [NGOs]) need up-to-date, detailed data for their operations. Some of them may already be struggling to maintain their own datasets. By joining with many partners, organizations find it easier to keep data relevant and up-to-date and to avoid reinventing the wheel. The data become more useful and more widely used, their application leading to greater innovation, which in turn encourages further collection of valuable data, which feed back into a robust open data ecosystem.

### 2.1.2 PARTNER OUTREACH

Government support and participation in an Open Cities mapping project is a key strategy for ensuring its sustainability. The OSM community is also a essential resource, along with other partners such as universities, civil society organizations, and the private sector. This subsection examines these likely partners and their potential roles.

#### 2.1.2.1 Government

In most contexts, governmental support will benefit a mapping initiative because different government units can provide resources and ensure better sustainability and legitimacy of the work. Therefore, they should be included as partners from the early stages of planning.

Government entities will benefit from access to up-to-date, detailed data that they already devote great resources to maintain. In the long-term, government can incorporate the Open Cities data collection methodology into national initiatives by sharing data, experience, and resources. This sort of buy-in will strengthen the project over time. In turn, government support can aid your project in terms of planning, legitimacy, access to existing data, and provision of local resources. Government, particularly the national and local agencies that already work in mapping and geographic data, can provide valuable insight concerning how to plan mapping activities efficiently. Their involvement also adds legitimacy. For example, mappers may face challenges from local people when surveying an area. With the engagement of local government or other authorities, mappers may carry ID cards or letters of approval to demonstrate official support for the project during data collection in the field.

Finally, useful existing data may be found in government storage. Although convincing government bodies to release their data freely to the public can be a challenge (or some data may be private or sensitive), much of the data will be more useful if opened for public access. Furthermore, if the information collected during the project can enhance and build upon government data, the government will benefit through the return of updated datasets. Open Cities can also be an entry point for the government to increase its capacities, update employees’ skills, and start integrating innovative tools and methods into its workflow to reduce costs and improve regular operations. To read more about the place of VGI in government, please visit the following  <a href="https://opendri.org/resource/crowdsourced-geographic-information-use-in-government/" target="_blank">link</a>.

Many different levels and parts of the government can be approached, depending on the focus of the project. When starting a project, identify those agencies that are most important to approach for support. Relevant government departments may cover the following areas:

<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Urban development</li>
        <li>Disaster management</li>
        <li>Mapping or surveying</li>
        <li>Census and statistics</li>
        <li>Information and communication technology</li>
        <li>Transportation</li>
        <li>Water and sanitation</li>
        <li>Local government (such as regional and municipal governments, village heads)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

#### 2.1.2.2 OpenStreetMap Community

Because Open Cities mapping is built upon the OSM platform, another group to communicate with is the existing OSM community. It is important to understand what the mapping community already looks like and how the Open Cities Project might best support and work with this existing group.

What is the OSM community? Simply put, anyone who actively contributes to OpenStreetMap in a given country or region is part of that community. In active communities, mappers communicate with each other often, plan mapping events, and collaborate on OSM development. In quieter communities, mappers communicate less but contribute for their own personal reasons. Active, vibrant communities are the most productive and sustainable, but no matter what the local OSM user base looks like, there are always possibilities to engage.

Even if direct partnership is not developed with existing OSM contributors, it is important to maintain communication with them and inform them of the project goals and target areas. Since Open Cities mapping will likely take place in an area where others have already mapped, the project must not overwrite the information already entered by volunteer mappers who used local knowledge to edit the map. It is critical that the project participants, as a volunteer community, coordinate any large data imports with the existing community and respects work that has already been accurately completed.



<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 2.0: Contacting Mappers</b></span>
  <p>There are several ways to get in touch with OSM mappers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>E-mail lists, and messaging groups. In many countries, mappers communicate through dedicated e-mail lists. You can find such lists at
    <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo" target="_blank">lists.openstreetmap.org Groups on apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram, are also popular.</a></li>
    <li>Facebook & Twitter. In many places, the OSM communities have chosen to communicate using Facebook groups, in many cases supplemented with Twitter counts. Therefore, you should search both Facebook and Twitter to find out whether there is a local group for OSM contributors in the areas you plan to map.</li>
    <li>Wiki pages or sites. It is important to check the status of mapping in certain areas by visiting the OSM Wiki site, starting with the main page at <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>. Most countries have at least one dedicated page to the status of the project.</li>
    <li>The “Neis One!” blog. Another useful starting point for connecting with the OSM community is Pascal Neis’s blog at
    <a href="http://neis-one.org" target="_blank">neis-one.org</a>, which provides tools that show which users are actively mapping in certain areas.</li>
    <li><a href="http://osm-analytics.org/#/" target="_blank">OSM Analytics</a>. OSM Analytics lets us understand mapping activity for defined geographical areas. You can set the geographical area of interest, and the time period of activity.</li>
    <li><a href="https://tasks.hotosm.org/" target="_blank">HOT Tasking Manager 3.0</a>: The OSM Tasking Manager Platform illustrates ongoing OSM projects that have been established by humanitarian and development agencies - projects that are actively recruiting mapper participation. Project boundaries (indicating what groups are working where, both currently, and in the past) are available, so that new groups can cross check for activity. </li>  
</ul>
</div>



#### 2.1.2.3 Other Groups

Other groups may also be considered potential collaborators. Table 2.1 describes several sources of potential partners.

Building partnerships is essential to reaching the higher-level goals of an Open Cities mapping project, such as strengthening the open-source mapping community. Ideally your partners will be directly involved in the planning and implementation of the project. However, if key partners cannot commit time and resources, it is still important to keep them informed about project activities. In this way, you can keep them connected and approach them again later as your project expands.

## 2.2 Defining the scope of work

The first step of Open Cities project planning is to clearly define the objectives. This means answering questions such as these:

<ul>
    <li>What is the scale of the project? Has this been done here before?</li>
    <li>What will the data be used for?</li>
    <li>What data will we collect?</li>
    <li>What geographic area will we cover?</li>
    <li>What is the time frame for project completion?</li>
</ul>



<div class="c-table">

### 2.2.1 Overview of the Process

Defining your project’s scope means considering how much area will be mapped, how much data will be collected, and how much time the project will require—a process illustrated in figure 2.2. These decisions will enable you to determine your personnel and resource requirements as well.

Although your long-term objective might be to map a large area such as a city, district, or even a country, it is advisable to begin with a smaller pilot project (box 2.1) and later scale up. This provides the necessary time and experience to build capacity in your team, nurture partnerships, and gain experience in the process.

The following sections will explain how to designate the target area and make rough estimates of the number of features to be mapped. We will discuss what a data model is, how it should be defined, and how to engage partners in this process. Last, we will consider how to manage a project’s time frame and ensure that tasks are completed in proper succession, so that your project effectively meets its deadlines and its goals.

<div class="c-box">
<span class="box-title"><b>Box 2.1 Pilot Projects</b></span>
  <p>Pilot projects typically map a small part of a much larger area, over a short time frame. The goals of pilot projects are not only to collect data but also to experiment with the surveying methodology and determine the most effective and efficient ways of mapping. Such projects are also useful for demonstrating the effectiveness of innovative mapping tools and strengthening local support.</p>

</div>

### 2.2.2 Why Are You Collecting the Data?

One of the first questions in designing a project is simply, “What will the data be used for?” In other words, why are you collecting data? You should have a good answer for this at the outset because it will define the sort of data that you want to collect.

For example, Open Cities projects are often oriented toward disaster risk reduction. In the case of disaster preparedness, this might mean collecting data about buildings and other critical infrastructure. For starters, the data would include the location of each building and its geometry (the building’s footprint on the ground), but it also includes information about other building attributes such as the number of levels in the building, the shape of the roof, and the materials used for the walls.

To determine which types of features and attributes the project should map, you will want to consult with the partners involved in the project. For example, you may be working closely with the government’s water and sanitation department—and they might not need buildings’ structural characteristics but will be very interested in using data about drainage lines and solid waste.

One potential challenge is that, with numerous partners wanting different information, you may end up with requests to map many different features along with a wide range of attributes for each. Such a large data model may not be practical to map with the resources at your disposal. Increasing the number of attributes collected has, in previous projects, decreased both the quantity of features mapped as well as the quality of the data. It is therefore important to limit the amount of collected information to only the most important features and attributes. Keeping things as simple as possible will help ensure project success, particularly in pilot projects.

<div class="c-box">
<span class="box-title"><b>Box 2.2 Combining Different Mapping Activities</b></span>
  <p>Different structural approaches to mapping offer varying advantages. This guide focuses on the most common approach: systematically mapping an area with an Open Cities project team (usually beginning with desktop mapping, followed up by validation and attribute collection on the ground). But the overall project  can be complemented by other activities, , such as by engaging and training volunteers, and hosting events like mapping parties, inviting partners from the community, local university and local governments.</p>
  <p>Remember that the more individuals and organizations that are involved in your project, the stronger it becomes. The more participants you have, the more users, contributors, and awareness of the data you will have—which, in turn, strengthens the open data ecosystem for the future. We always recommend engaging a formal project team, due to the formal demands and practical goals of a mapping project, but you are encouraged to combine traditional hiring methods with both volunteer and open training opportunities,  as this will engage others in the mapping process, and contribute toward a sustainable local mapping community.  It is important to remember that the inclusion of additional individuals and organizations involves logistics and planning that is both time consuming, and not without expense. But, an extended team can help map large areas quickly, and their involvement can create a sense of community and ownership around the project. The project team will have to weight the pro’s and con’s of these kinds of partnerships, and plan accordingly.
</p>
</div>

### 2.2.3 Defining the Target Area

You should precisely determine your intended survey area from the start. Are you mapping an entire city? Part of a city? An arbitrary area?

Let’s say that you are mapping a city. You may simply think, “We are mapping City X. That is the area, and it has been defined.” But what does that mean? Does that mean the official government boundaries of City X? Are we interested in the entire urban area or only the city center? If the target area coincides with an existing administrative division, the area will be easy to define, though it might not follow natural roads and features as well as you might like.

Finally, it will benefit you a great deal to know as much as you can about your target area from the beginning. Think about questions such as these:
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>How large is the target area in square kilometers?</li>
        <li>How many people live there?</li>
        <li>How many buildings and roads are in the area?</li>
        <li>What will be the main challenges of mapping this area?</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### 2.2.4 Building the Data Model

A data model is a detailed description of all the data you want to collect in your field survey: the features you want to identify and the attributes of those features you want to collect. To a large extent, the data model will relate to the available time and resources for the project—either determining how much you will need or what the constraints might be due to predetermined limits. To complete this data model, determine how much data you will collect, which methods you will use to collect it, and whether privacy or sensitivity concerns will limit what you collect.

<b>Quantity of data.</b> Defining a data model may be easy or it may take some time. If many partners are involved who want to collect many different types of data, deciding on which data to collect could prove to be a challenge. Remember that you may not want your surveyors to collect 100 or even a couple of dozen attributes about every feature on the ground. The more attributes you must collect, the greater the time and resources you will need for data collection.

<b>Collection methods.</b> You will also need to decide whether surveyors will collect only those attributes that are directly observable, or whether they will be required to speak with building occupants. Speaking with building occupants will take considerably longer than surveying simply through observation. This decision will greatly affect the surveyors’ mapping speed and therefore the time frame and cost of the project. Some projects may decide to perform an exhaustive "census" of infrastructure, such as the the buildings or roads, for basic attributes or information about their condition or construction materials. More detailed survey information could be collected from building occupants using a predefined sampling method - so perhaps interview only every 10th house, or, a random sample of houses within the community

<b>Sensitivity of data.</b> Remember also that the data you are collecting will be shared on an open-source database. You will not want to collect data that may be considered private or sensitive.

Figure 2.3 shows part of a sample data model (for a complete sample form, see Appendix 6.1, “Data Design”). It is a good idea to write down the list of features you want to collect and, beneath each feature, to list the attributes you want to collect. For example, one feature you will likely be mapping is roads. Defining the data model for roads means determining which attributes you want to collect, such as the following:
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Type of road</li>
        <li>Name of road (in one or multiple languages)</li>
        <li>Surface types of road (asphalt, concrete, brick, stones, gravel, or unpaved)</li>
        <li>Direction of traffic (one-way, two-way, or variable by time of day)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

### 2.2.5 Estimating a Time Frame

Project duration may not be something you can define from the start, but you should be able to estimate it. Will it take a month? Four to eight months? A year? This will become clearer as you plan your project and consider the logistics (especially when you consider the quality of the existing map data: see next section, 2.3), but you should begin developing an idea of the time required to complete the project.

Be sure to think through the factors that will affect your survey work, and include them when working on your time frame. How much desktop mapping is required before embarking on field data collection? Will major holidays occur during the proposed time period? How many days each week do you expect your staff to work? How many hours per day will they realistically be able to work? Keep in mind considerations such as regular work breaks, time for prayers, time for classes (if the staff will include students), travel time, and so on. Weather can also be a significant factor in the ability to conduct field work (rainy season, heat wave). Allow a time buffer in the collection timetable for this.

Figure 2.4 illustrates part of a sample project time frame.

During the Open Cities Dhaka pilot project, for example, a single survey team of two could collect field data for about 50 buildings per day by mapping for three or four hours. In some locations, it is common to cover 100 or more buildings per day. Use metrics like these to estimate how long it will take to map a certain region. If you can estimate the number of features in an area and the time it will take to map them, you can better understand the likely time frame of your project.

## 2.3 Assessing existing map resources

Once you have established the foundation of your project, you must assess the resources that are available for mapping. For example,
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Are there any preexisting data that will be useful and available? (Imagery, or GIS files of critical infrastructure, such as schools or hospitals, from a government partner, or agency working in the area)</li>
        <li>Is the target area covered by Bing or Mapbox, or Digital Globe imagery? Are other sources available? <a href="https://openaerialmap.org/" target="_blank">OpenAerialMap</a> is an open service providing access to growing catalog of openly licensed imagery and map layer services.</li>
        <li>Is the resolution and timestamp of the freely available imagery suitable for mapping your study area?</li>
        <li>Will you need to fly a drone to acquire up-to-date imagery of sufficient quality? (If your project is in response to a recent event that had changed the landscape, including the destruction of property, then this may be the best option for you.)</li>
        <li>Do you have GPS units available? Mobile phones? Will you need them?</li>
    </ul>
</div>

The purpose of such resources is twofold. First, it is always better to start with some objects already on the map, rather than with an empty canvas. If you already have two streets drawn on the map, you can easily add a school at their intersection. But if you don’t have those streets drawn on the map, you have no landmarks by which you can correctly locate the school, thus requiring much more work. Therefore, it is always best to have an existing base map before going into the field.

Second, these resources aid you while you are mapping. For example, if you are carrying a satellite picture with you while out surveying, you can usually identify objects by comparing what you see to what is shown on the image. This will also help you to understand the correct sizes and shapes of features. Later, the imagery can be used to accurately trace, or readjust polygonal features on OpenStreetMap.

### 2.3.1 Existing Digital and Paper Data

Because Open Cities uses the OSM platform, there will almost certainly be pre-existing data on the map. The OSM project has been around for nearly a decade, and there are few places in the world without at least a few roads already drawn. This is helpful because it means that Open Cities projects do not start from scratch. It is important to remember, however, that your project mappers should not delete features that others have created. The purpose here is to collaborate and work with other users as well. Once you have defined your project target area, it is a good idea to examine the existing OSM map and assess how detailed it already is. You should also contact any active OSM users in that area to let them know what the project is about and to see whether there are any opportunities for collaboration.

Often, other sources of data will also be available to you. Public government data might exist in either digital or paper format. In Open Cities Sri Lanka, regional paper maps already existed in each district. Surveyors used them as references to make improved, digital maps with OpenStreetMap.

Digital data often exist as well. In the Open Cities Dhaka pilot project, for example, the team received permission to use old government road and building data. They decided it would be easier to use these data as a base layer that could be updated rather than starting from a clean slate, and so the data were first imported into OpenStreetMap.

#### 2.3.1.1 Data Imports

Importing data can save time and work if there are existing data that correspond to your data model and that you are free to use. For example, if you plan to map 5,000 buildings and the city government has footprints for all those buildings, you might consider importing the data into the OpenStreetMap database. Box 2.5 further discusses how to work successfully with the OSM community on data imports.

If it takes 30 seconds to draw the geometry of a building, then it would take approximately 40 hours to draw 5,000 buildings—a week of someone’s time.

Before you think about importing data, you must consider the following:
<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Are the data of good quality? How and when were they created? Are they better than, as good as, or worse than data you would collect yourselves?</li>
        <li>Are the data in the public domain, or do you need explicit permission from the agency that created the data?</li>
        <li>Is the net benefit of importing the data greater than the cost of creating it new?</li>
        <li>Who will import the data?</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Written permission is generally required from agencies that are willing to donate data to OpenStreetMap, and they must understand that once they offer the data, the data will go into an open-source database that anyone can use. Obtaining this permission can be easy in some cases, where opendata is becoming a more accepted concept, but many agencies are still rather protective of their data, and it remains a  challenge to both acquire permission, and convey the meaning of an open license. For a sample permission letter, see Appendix 6.3.

Importing data is not difficult, but it requires an advanced understanding of OpenStreetMap and can take a significant amount of time, because imported data must be manually merged with existing OSM data. If you do decide that importing data is the right course to take, you must have a clear plan of how to import the data and discuss it beforehand with the OSM community.

<div class="c-box">
<span class="box-title"><b>Box 2.2 Imagery and Licensing</b></span>
  <p>A common question during any mapping project is, “Why can we use imagery from Bing, or Digital Globe but not from Google?” The short answer, and one not always easily understood, is licensing.</p>
  <p>Any company or organization that sells or distributes imagery has a license describing what users are allowed to do with it. In most cases, people are forbidden from making derivative products. This means we are not allowed to use imagery to help make maps unless we receive specific permission to do so. Because Google has not given permission for the OSM community to use its imagery—or any other information from Google—as a resource, such use is not allowed, and edits derived from Google are illegal.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, both Digital Globe and Microsoft have given explicit permission for OSM contributors to use their imagery, both of which have excellent quality imagery in many parts of the world. It is always best to check these resources first and to assess the quality of the images in your project’s target area. Available imagery sources can be viewed in the Java OpenStreetMap Editor (JOSM).</p>

#### 2.3.1.2 Other Local Data Sources

Consult the sources described below to find additional existing local data.

<b>Mapping agencies.</b> Most national governments have a department or agency that deals exclusively with mapping. Whether it is called the survey department or something else, it is responsible for managing a country’s geographic data. If the department or agency is willing to provide some of its data as public information, it can be a prime source for acquiring existing data.

<b>National Statistical Offices.</b> Most countries will have a dedicated department or agency that deals with the official counting and surveying of the population. Such agencies typically maintain the boundaries of enumeration units for the country - the administrative units to which census data is amalgamated. The statistical agency can be a key source of data for population estimates, and projections.

<b>Urban development agencies.</b> Some cities or countries have government departments specifically oriented toward urban development. Such agencies may possess a wealth of urban-oriented geodata.

<b>OCHA.</b> The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has had a local presence in many countries for many years. It typically has plenty of local knowledge and often is more willing than government agencies to make its data available.

<b>NGOs.</b> Typically hundreds if not thousands of NGOs exist in a given locale, and those working in certain fields may have collected data from previous projects. Organizations working in disaster relief, water and sanitation, or urban development are good places to begin asking around.

### 2.3.2 Availability of Imagery for Digitization

Perhaps the most effective aid in mapping is aerial imagery, as shown in figure 2.5. Aerial images are photographs taken from satellites or airplanes, which are then oriented accurately by their location on Earth.

Aerial images can be viewed as a background in the OpenStreetMap editing software. Mappers can use what they see to trace lines. This can be useful before field surveys, to create a skeleton base map that shows roads, buildings, and anything else that is identifiable solely from the imagery.

Aerial imagery can also be used during field surveys and editing. It can be printed out and carried in the field, helping mappers to orient themselves and identify features on the ground. Later, when they are editing, they can reference the sketches and notes they made in the field with the imagery in the editing software and accurately draw objects on the map.

While preparing for a project, the identification of suitable imagery should be undertaken early. If good quality, high-resolution imagery is available, this will benefit your project tremendously and mean less time and less work. If you cannot find good imagery, however, other methods will be required for digitizing objects on the ground.

Figure 2.5 Use of an Aerial Image to Trace Lines on a Map

#### 2.3.2.1 Assessing Bing and Mapbox Imagery

Several imagery sources are available to OSM users, but those with the widest coverage and the highest-quality images are, DigitalGlobe,  Microsoft’s Bing search engine (figure 2.6), ESRI and Mapbox, which provides open-source base maps, design tools, and OSM-powered street data. OpenAerialMap is also becoming an increasingly reliable imagery option.  Box 2.2 discusses the importance of using only those sources that have given permission to use the imagery.

Figure 2.6: Example of a Good Aerial Imagery from Digital Globe Premium
<div class="c-box-image">
    <img src="/images/posts/2/2-6-2.jpg" alt="figure 2.6">
</div>

After defining your target area, you should assess to what extent you will be able to use this imagery, assuming that you plan to use it for your survey. If you are lucky, high-resolution imagery will cover your entire target area. Usually, however, parts of your target area will be obscured by clouds (figure 2.7) or not have high-resolution imagery at all.

Figure 2.7: Cloudy Aerial Imagery
<div class="c-box-image">
    <img src="/images/posts/2/2-7-2.jpg" alt="figure 2.7">
</div>

During the planning stage, consider using GIS software to draw lines around the parts of your target area where Bing imagery will be suitable for mapping as well as those areas for which usable imagery is unavailable. This will help you understand what proportion of the target area will require another imagery source or a different methodology.

#### 2.3.2.2 DRONE IMAGERY

Another option for groups is to either commision or, to collect high resolution drone imagery for their study site. This is a high cost option, but, if the data collection project is in direct response to changes in the landscape, that have happened recently, then it may be the most reliable option.

Option 1: Hiring a drone operator<br>
Considerations

<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Cost (will this be a recurring cost that you are prepared for, if, you intend to increase the spatial scope of your project over time - perhaps ask about discounts for bulk work)</li>
        <li>Ownership rights (who owns the imagery, and what will the license for use contain)</li>
        <li>Post processing (does your provider georectify the imagery for you, so that it is ready to “plug and play” in OSM</li>
        <li>Permissions (make sure that any vendor you work with is appropriately licenses, and has permission to fly in the study area)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Option 2: Buying a drone<br>
Considerations

<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Cost (drones are relatively high cost, though there are some less expensive options. There is a trade off between ease of use, quality of the resulting imagery, and overall price. Does your group see a legitimate use for the equipment going forward. Do you have plans to map in other areas, or a business model to use the Drone for other ventures to offset the cost. Formal training is also quite costly)</li>
        <li>Training (team will need training on the use of the drone itself, and in the post processing of the imagery. Take into account, that formal training may be preferential, but can be expensive. Training, and testing will add considerable time to the work plan especially if licensing is required in the study country)</li>
        <li>Permissions (permission to fly, and licensing for the operator are all legitimate concerns, and can at cost, in both time and money to the project budget)</li>
        <li>Funding options (perhaps suggest application for grants, or, contacting the vendor directly to see if there are free/low cost programs for humanitarian/development efforts)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

#### 2.3.2.3 ALTERNATIVE IMAGERY SOURCES

Finding alternative imagery sources is a lot like finding possible data you can import. There is usually some imagery floating around, but it is often of questionable age and usefulness, and of even more questionable legal right to use.

Typically satellite images that have been purchased from a major provider like DigitalGlobe are not licensed for use in mapping in OpenStreetMap unless specifically designated as such, and any company or agency that has these data does not have the right to reuse the data for this purpose. However, imagery created directly by governments and companies may be usable. If someone is willing to donate imagery, the license should be investigated at the start.

Imagery can be purchased from companies such as DigitalGlobe, but this can quickly become expensive. It is usually best to find freely available sources of imagery, which are also more sustainable in the long run.

 <a href="https://openaerialmap.org" target="_blank">OpenAerialMap</a> is an open service providing access to a growing catalog of openly licensed imagery, captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), or drones. As its catalog grows, OpenAerialMap is becoming an increasingly valuable imagery source for the OSM community.

In some cases, imagery is made available through the U.S. Department of State’s Imagery to the Crowd initiative. This is typically provided in the aftermath of disasters to aid remote mappers. Learn more about Imagery to the Crowd at <a href="http://gfdrr.github.io/community-mapping/mapgive.state.gov" target="_blank">mapgive.state.gov</a>. Remember, too, that using aerial imagery as a background layer is generally considered to be the easiest way to map, particularly when many buildings need to be digitized.

### 2.3.3 GPS Devices, Field Papers, and Smartphones

If traceable imagery is unavailable for part or all of your target area, having a good base map becomes even more important. If detailed, existing data such as road networks and landmarks are already on the map, you should be able to use this as a reference to add new features in their correct locations. If a good base map is not already available, you will need to use GPS to build up a base map of your area.

GPS devices allow mappers to record paths along which they walk as well as individual locations, which are stored with accurate latitudes and longitudes. These data can be imported into JOSM and then traced to add features to the database. When no imagery is available, it is a good idea to use GPS to build up a base map first. Survey teams can first traverse an area with GPS devices, locating roads and major landmarks. In a second stage, they can use this base map as a reference to go out and collect more detailed data.

A service for OSM known as Field Papers enables mappers to print out a piece of paper that displays either an existing OSM map, satellite imagery, or a combination of both. The mappers take the Field Papers into the field, draw on them, write notes, and add features to the map—an example of which is shown in figure 2.8. Later, the papers can be scanned back into the computer and automatically geo-referenced to their correct locations on the globe. It is then a simple process of digitizing the hand-drawn notes.

This process can be used for building up the base map, as well as for the daily mapping activities of a project. Each day, mappers will print out Field Papers of small areas, which surveyors can use to sketch buildings and areas using the correctly located roads as a reference.

Figures 2.8 and 2.9 show examples using Field Papers “atlas maps.” Creating rough sketches of building shapes and their locations is not very precise, and often mappers wonder whether this is a problem. Ideally, building shapes will be more accurate, but such accuracy is difficult without high resolution imagery to use as a reference. If this mapping methodology is used, it is not a major problem. More important than precise building size and location is the topology—which helps to ensure that the buildings are placed correctly in relation to each other and in relation to the (accurately positioned) roads.

Field papers are not just a paper reference of what you encounter in the field. Each map sheet has a unique QR code that allows the team member to photograph, or scan the map and georeference it, so that it can be displayed in an OSM editor. Using the field paper as “Wallpaper”, desktop mappers can digitally trace the work of the field mapper, and transfer/transcribe any attribute that the field mapper has documented on the map sheet.

Even if a mapping project intends to rely on mobile technology for field data collection; it is always a good idea to take field papers into the field, as unanticipated tech issues, or, infrastructure inconsistent with the imagery displayed on screen, is much easier to edit, or document directly onto the field papers.

#### 2.3.3.1 MOBILE APPLICATIONS

You can use various different mobile applications to collect OpenStreetMap data, and the list continues to grow rapidly.
Although mobile mapping applications are useful, none of them provides the range of editing features found on the desktop software.
Mobile applications are best at mapping points of interest. For a list of Android editing applications, see: <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android#OpenStreetMap_editing_features" target="_blank">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Android#OpenStreetMap_editing_features</a>.

Some of the more popular applications are listed below:

<div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>Mapillary: Mapillary is a crowd-sourced service for sharing geotagged photos. Users can upload and share street-level images of places around the world, similar to Google's proprietary StreetView. Uploaded photos become immediately available for all editors and anyone with a smartphone or computer is able to contribute.</li>

        <li>Maps.me: This mobile application allows users to add tags in OSM and download offline maps. Data uploaded is immediately live in the OSM database. The app is available for iOS, Android, and Blackberry. </li>

        <li>OSM Contributor: Useful for mapping parties, this mobile application is used to map and to manage group mapping. Mappers can add, edit, and remove nodes, ways, and comments. Mapping managers can limit contributions by data type and region. </li>

        <li>OsmAnd: This mobile application offers offline OpenStreetMap viewing on smartphones and navigation capabilities for Android. OsmAnd’s Editing plugin allows users to create points and edit tags directly on OSM. Users can also turn on the trip recording plugin to automatically trace the path of their journey as a track on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces." target="_blank">https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces</a>. </li>

        <li>OSMTracker: An offline GPS tracker for collecting points of interest and recording GPX tracks. OSMTracker creates a gpx trace of a user's journey with waypoints along the route. Voice recording, photographs, and notes can also be geolocated along the route. Data exported is compatible with the offline JOSM map editor.</li>

        <li>OpenDataKit and OpenMapKit: Open Data Kit (ODK) is a free and open-source toolset which allows the user to build a mobile data collection form or survey, and aggregate the collected data on a server. OpenDataKit is integrated with the OpenMapKit (OMK) extension, an Android app allowing ODK users to georeference survey data directly to unique OSM features. OMK also supports OSM feature selection and tagging.</li>

        <li>KoBoCollect: KoBoCollect is based on the open source application OpenDataKit. KoBo allows you to build surveys and collect data on a range of subjects from household assessments to building materials. KoBo does not tie directly to OSM in the way that the previous applications do, so requires a process for the reconciliation of collected on KoBo, with OSM itself. </li>

        <li>Vespucci: The Vespucci Android application allows online and offline OSM editing. Editing is supported by rich, extensible and searchable presets based on the JOSM system and compatible 3rd party presets can be downloaded directly to your device. </li>

        </ul>
</div>

## 2.4 Building the Team (staffing)

While preparing for your project, consider the logistics that will be involved in terms of staff and office work. Remember that half of the job involves surveying the target area, and the other half is editing work on computers, some of which may need to happen before any field mapping takes place. You may have a small project team, or you may have dozens of people or more. Box 2.4 discusses some of these considerations.

Consider whether all of your staff will perform some desktop editing, or whether you will divide the tasks of surveyor and editor. It is generally beneficial for mappers to do both surveying and editing, rather than splitting the work, because mappers remember what they have surveyed; even with detailed notes, nobody will be able to edit the map as well as the person who surveyed the features being mapped. Editing tasks also help to overcome “survey fatigue”—when surveyors tire from spending most of their days walking around to perform a single task (and vice versa for editors staying at the computer all day). That said, logistical considerations may require that these two tasks be split, or that different people are editing in the office at different times.


<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 2.3 Common Roles</b></span>
  <p>Open Cities mapping project teams generally include people in the several roles described below.</p>
  <p><b>DATA COLLECTION</b></p>
  <p><b>Surveyor and Editor (Mapper)</b></p>
  <p>Surveyors typically work in pairs. Each pair is responsible for field surveying—usually during half of the day, as it can be quite physically tiring. They may also engage in small tasks such as printing field papers. In most projects, each survey team also edits its own work, but these roles can be split. Each day, the pairs will be tasked with part of the target area to map, and they will spend three to five hours surveying, with the remainder of their time spent editing the data.</p>
  <p><b>Validator</p></b>
  <p>Experienced editors may dedicate some or all of their time to the quality assurance process as data validators. Validators review collected data for errors and inconsistencies. Validators are assigned areas they have not personally surveyed in order to spot and correct inconsistent practices between survey teams.</p>

  <p><b>MANAGEMENT</b></p>
  <p><b>Project Lead/Manager</b></p>
  <p>At the top of the management structure is typically a project lead (PL). The PL may be the same person as the project manager, or the two roles may be separated. Ideally, the PL will have in-depth local knowledge and relationships with government and academia. The PL, aside from supervising the mapping project, is usually responsible for high-level discussions with partners and community outreach. The PL should be well versed in field data collection and skilled in project management, mapping and GIS, communication skills, and community building.</p>
  <p><b>Mapping Supervisor</b></p>
  <p>A small pilot project may have only a single supervisor, or there may be multiple team supervisors, each of whom manages a subset of mappers, and who report to a top-level project manager. Supervisors are responsible for organizing the project workflow, supervising and aiding mappers, and managing equipment and logistics.</p>

  <p><b>DEVELOPMENT & SUPPORT</b></p>
  <p><b>Communications Officer</b></p>
  <p>Depending on the project size and length, a devoted communications officer may be necessary to focus on external communications, social networking, community building and integration. The participatory aspect of Open Cities is built around solid and regular communication.</p>
  <p><b>Technical Support</b></p>
  <p>A devoted technician may be required for setting up and managing software and hardware for the survey efforts, especially if the mapping team is large.</p>
  <p><b>GIS or Information Officer</b></p>
  <p>The project may require specific analytical tools, products, or other outputs. Therefore it is important to have someone on the team who can produce high quality maps and information products based on the data collected.</p>
</div>

### 2.4.1 Management Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities

You can organize your staff in various ways. A single manager can supervise a large group of mappers, or you may choose to divide the team into a number of smaller teams that can operate somewhat independently. (Box 2.4 describes some of these roles.) Either way, you will need people to perform the following tasks:

<div class="c-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Field surveying</li>
    <li>Editing</li>
    <li>Printing Field Papers (see 2.4.3)</li>
    <li>Managing equipment</li>
    <li>Organizing workflow</li>
    <li>Procuring office supplies</li>
    <li>Quality assurance</li>
    <li>Technical support</li>
    <li>Training, and volunteer mobilization</li>
    <li>Communication and outreach (both to the community, and to partner organizations)</li>
    <li>Data Analytics and map production</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Mappers are responsible for the day-to-day activities of a project. They are the ones going out to different locations each day within the target area, identifying features, and writing down attributes. They also spend time in the project office, editing the data they collect each day and adding those data to OpenStreetMap. Because their skills will grow, the quality and pace of their work will improve over time. Mappers may also perform office tasks, procure supplies, work with volunteers, or train partner organizations.

A good manager should keep the mappers on schedule and help them as needed. Managers will be more experienced in GIS and OpenStreetMap, so that they can effectively advise mappers during the editing process. It is important that managers check for mistakes and errors in the data, especially early in a project, so that they can inform mappers of their mistakes before they are repeated hundreds of times.

Good managers also maintain strong communication with their mappers and should occasionally accompany them during surveys to observe their work and offer advice. Managers are responsible for performing quality assurance surveys, which will be discussed in section 4.3, “Quality Control.”

<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 2.5 Data Imports and the OSM Community</b></span>
  <p>What is the OSM Community? OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project involving hundreds of thousands of users and contributors, and the “OSM community” comprises those active members who continually participate by adding to or updating the map.</p>
  <p>Each country has what might be called its own community (or in some cases multiple groups), who communicate, plan activities, and work together to improve the map. And each country’s community is also connected to the larger global OSM user base. Because an Open Cities project uses the OSM platform, it is automatically engaged in this community. Section 2.2.2.2 earlier provided more information about engaging the local OSM community.</p>
  <p>Most OpenStreetMap users go out and contribute to the map bit by bit, so they should be consulted before importing their data. The import might overwrite the work of other mappers who have actually conducted field surveys. You must also send an e-mail to imports@openstreetmap.org and let them know what you are planning. Ensuring that they are aware and supportive of the process before any importing takes place can save a lot of time explaining or reverting the changes after the fact.</p>
  <p>For a complete description of the steps to be taken for an OSM import, view this OSM Wiki page: <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines" target="_blank">http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines</a></p>.
</div>

### 2.4.2 Finding Mappers and Surveyors

Survey staff are often sourced from universities and from recent university graduates. Prolonged field activity can be demanding and is suitable for young people who have an interest in fields related to GIS, geography, urban planning, and engineering. However, the surveying and editing process is not difficult; with the right training, anyone can fill the role, even those with limited computer experience. Those with less computer and geography experience may take longer to train but can still fulfill the job requirements, and direct knowledge of the study area being mapped can be a distinct advantage. Mappers are also often found through other partners, such as government agencies, youth groups, and high schools.

As you reach out to potential partners, key influencers and casual mappers will be identified who are interested in the project focus and can be added to the team as the project expands. A unique aspect of the Open Cities data collection methodology is the use of crowdsourcing from both the international and local OSM mapping communities. When engaging the local community, it is often students who have the time and interest to contribute to the project. An Open Cities project provides the opportunity for knowledge exchange between academia and the implementing organization. As a result, the surveyors can be sourced from local university students and recent graduates in geography, computer science, or other project-related technical disciplines. Check for a Youthmappers chapter in your area to engage <a href="http://www.youthmappers.org/chapter-listing" target="_blank">(http://www.youthmappers.org/chapter-listing)</a>.

### 2.4.3 Compensation and Incentives

There are various methods for compensating project members depending on their background and interests. If you assemble a management structure with a team of managers (known as a core project team), they will most likely be paid as full-time staff. Others, such as volunteer students or young professionals, may either be strictly volunteers, incentivized through an internship or academic credit, or offered per diem or even full-time payment.

Because OpenStreetMap is an open data project built around a community of volunteers, a frequent debate concerns whether mappers should be paid during a targeted mapping project. On the one hand, it is preferable to find ways to encourage mapping other than payment in order to foster a sustainable initiative and mapping community. On the other hand, a targeted mapping project may require mappers to dedicate a great deal of their time to complete the work within a given time frame. In the end, the choices about how to compensate or incentivize mappers will depend on the particular demands of the project.

Volunteer mappers can be incentivized by designing the position as an internship opportunity, by working with universities so that they receive academic credit, or by simply offering the reward of community service and skills development. The broader benefits of participation were discussed earlier, in section 2.1.1.

Another approach toward providing incentives is to develop competitions between universities, departments, or parts of the mapping community. Although monetary rewards have been found to lead to a spike in data collection, collection may also dramatically decrease after a competition is over. Therefore, although competitions provide a potentially useful way to gather a lot of data, they are not necessarily a good way to support community growth in the project focus area. In the case of a mapping competition, creative prizes or rewards (such as mapping hardware) can be used as incentives that may not result in temporary, opportunistic mapping.
