# LOGISTICS & TRAINING

## 3.1 Finding a workspace

A major consideration is the location of the project office. If you already have an office, you should consider whether it is in, or close to, the target area. Remember that travel between the editing location and the area being mapped is time-consuming; hence, planning transportation logistics is important. If you can save your mappers some time, the project should take less time and cost less money. It may be worthwhile to organize an office space close to the target area so that the mapping process runs more smoothly.

In any case, care should be taken so that the office used for editing has a minimum of electrical, computer, and Internet problems. Because OpenStreetMap editing works best with a good Internet connection, frequent disconnection is enough to effectively halt the process, wasting valuable time and slowing progress. If your staff comes in for editing and has no Internet access, they have nothing to do and you lose half a day of time. A prolonged outage can be even more costly.

If Internet access is often lost, consider purchasing backup connections such as 3G modems. The additional cost often will outweigh the cost of lost time while waiting for service to return.

Other considerations for your workspace include opportunities for community engagement and collaborative work. While not strictly necessary, it may be beneficial to have a meeting room that can accommodate a dozen people—ideally one that is easily reconfigurable to serve a wide variety of functions. Training could also be conducted here, although if you have many mappers to train, you may need to identify a larger facility for the initial training.

When possible, the office should provide a creative communal space furnished with items such as whiteboards and couches. This will encourage open discussion and facilitate brainstorming to identify current and future challenges, examine alternatives, and develop solutions or alternative actions.

The initial project phases involve engaging the local OSM community and hosting mapping workshops (or mapping parties) to raise awareness of the Open Cities project and identify interested individuals, communities, schools, government departments, and private organizations. Mapping parties can be organized either at the project office or at other venues in the focus area such as university labs, private or public offices, community centers, and libraries. Of course, the budget should take into consideration the potential costs of renting these temporary venues.

## 3.2 Equipment and other costs

When you are preparing a mapping project budget, be sure to consider a number of other potential costs, including the equipment, supply, and service expenses described below. See box 3.1 for an estimate of the hardware needed to serve a 10-person project team.

<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 3.1 Hardware List</b></span>
  <p>The following hardware will serve a project team of at least 10 people, depending on mapping methodology:</p>
  <div class="c-list">
    <ul>
       <li>5 laptops (assumes one mapping team per laptop)</li>
       <li>5 android phones (if you plan on a mobile survey, maps.me, or mapillary)</li>
       <li>2 GPS devices (assumes you will use GPS, but not all the time)</li>
       <li>1 printer (for printing Field Papers and survey forms) along with necessary ink and paper</li>
       <li>1 projector (for presenting the project to partners and for trainings)</li>
     </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### 3.2.1 Hardware Needs

<b>Computers:</b> Data entry and analysis for OSM generally requires desktop or laptop computers. Laptops, being portable, can also be used to facilitate training sessions or mapping parties at venues away from the team’s office. Typically, one computer for every two members of your mapping team will suffice, unless the project requires an aggressive desktop mapping component before fieldwork takes place. Then access to additional machines, at least for the first desktop mapping phase would be important.

<b>Projector:</b> A projector is required for sensitization and awareness-raising presentations and in mapping workshops where the venue does not provide a projector. It will also be used when these presentations are offered at the office.

<b>Handheld GPS devices:</b> GPS units will record the “track” of the mappers (where they went while collecting data) and can record points of interest (POIs). With the improved quality of GPS technology on mobile devices, many teams opt to use their phones exclusively to gather GPS data, especially as tracking and recording features are built in to many of the apps dedicated to OSM data collection.

<b>Mobile Android mapping devices:</b> Instead of GPS units, you may opt to use Mobile Android devices. A variety of smartphone applications provide specific OSM mapping functionality, as well as the added benefit of mobile survey deployment (tools like OpenDataKit, or Kobo Collect), should your project incorporate this activity. Currently, Android applications such as Maps.me, OSMAnd, Mapillary and OSMTracker are popular. Mobile devices such as these usually have GPS chips inside them, allowing them to behave like a GPS device, but with additional functionality.

<b>Drones:</b>Drones are becoming an increasingly popular addition to the OSM workflow for community mapping projects. They allow immediate access to high resolution imagery, which can be captured on demand for a particular study area. This is extremely useful in areas where the the resolution of standard Bing or Digital Globe imagery is not sufficient to support quality desktop mapping. This is often the case in densely populated areas, where identification of individual rooftops is difficult when capturing buildings. They are also important in study areas where ground conditions are apt to change (such as communities that suffer from regular flooding, or progressive erosion). Regularly captured imagery allows us to map change over time, and to provide time stamped situational awareness for both response and planning purposes. Despite the attractiveness of “Imagery on demand” - drones come with many financial and logistical considerations. Teams must consider the initial cost of the equipment, and any training that will be required. This applies to both the manual operation of the equipment, but also the post processing of the imagery for use in open source applications. There may also be legal restrictions on drone operation in one’s country, or a licensing process for new drone operators. These factors need to be considered in both the budget and timeline aspect of any projects, as the cost, and time investment may outweigh the benefits.

### 3.2.2 Printing Needs

<b>Printer:</b> A printer will be needed to print the Field Papers. If you are using paper survey forms to collect attributes for many features, such as buildings, you may require thousands of photocopies. This process takes time and money, and it should be considered while planning logistics. Mapping teams are increasingly turning to mobile device for survey collection, and though the initial cost may be higher, they can prove to be more cost effective, and time efficient in the long run.  

<b>Business cards and brochures:</b> These materials are useful when establishing credibility in the field. Community members can be suspicious of mappers collecting data, and it is necessary to ease their concerns. A printed brochure will outline the project methodology and goals. Cards and brochures can easily be distributed while collecting data in the field—raising awareness of the project in the community and boosting credibility when fielding questions. Business cards and brochures should be distributed at all presentations and meetings. Mappers can also display their credentials using lanyards with clear display pockets.

<b>Letters of Support:</b> If preparing a brochure package for field mappers to use for community informational purposes, it would be a good idea to print and include any letters of support from the local government.

<b>Event signage and promotional materials:</b> Other printed materials include banners and posters for larger events such as mapping workshops.

### 3.2.3 Mapping Workshop Expenses

<b>Rent:</b> Community mapping workshops should be held in a variety of locations, in order to expose a wide range of actors to the process. Where possible, a host should be identified to provide the venue. This could be a community center, a local government office, or, a university building. If this is not feasible, a venue should be rented.

<b>Food:</b> Although workshops will vary in length, they should typically be half- or full-day events (Three hours minimum for adequate training, and some mapping). Providing  a meal, such as lunch for the mappers, or even coffee and snacks can go a long way toward increasing productivity and general well-being. Identifying potential sponsors for these activities, can help to offset the cost of training events (sponsorship can include space donation, help with rental fees, WIFI costs, or food costs). In many cases sponsor employees may like to be involved in the training and mapping activities.  

<b>Internet connectivity and electricity:</b> Internet connectivity is a critical consideration for all stages of a community mapping effort and, where possible, groups should establish redundant systems in case connectivity fails. Mobile hotspots can be sufficient for small groups of mappers, or for loading field papers, but typically insufficient for a Mapathon. Rechargeable batteries or power banks should be available for the projector and any GPS devices or smartphones

### 3.2.4 Surveying Expenses

<b>Surveying and office supplies:</b> The mappers will need clipboards, pens, and pencils to complete surveying tasks.

<b>Transportation expenses:</b> When specific sites have been identified to map, transportation may be required to take mappers into the field and return them to the venue, where data can be entered to OSM.

<b>Mobile Android mapping devices:</b> As mentioned in the previous section, mobile android devices are an efficient, and in many ways more cost effective approach to survey data collection.

## 3.3 Training

Once you have established your management structure and hired staff, you will need to train them. On a practical level, they will need to know how to map with OpenStreetMap, how to use the JOSM or iD editing software, and how to create and use Field Papers as well as any specialized information about the data they will be collecting. For example, if they are collecting data on buildings’ structural attributes, they will need to learn some engineering basics. We can separate the training components into two broad areas: those concerning OpenStreetMap tools and software and those concerning surveying techniques and understanding the data model.

Take the time and care to train the staff thoroughly. Remember that you are essentially training your future trainers, because good managers and mappers will be able to teach others about mapping and offer trainings with partner organizations and with volunteers. If it fits within your management structure, it is a good idea to a have a core team of managers who are more extensively trained than the mappers whom they oversee. The core team should become experts in OpenStreetMap and surveying techniques, so they will be equipped to manage and provide answers to other mappers. In Open Cities Dhaka, for example, a core team was trained over the course of a week and went to the field each day to practice surveying and then editing in the office. Although they were not experts after a week, they were able to lead a two-day training for a larger group of mappers and answer most of their questions.

### 3.3.1 Training on Mapping Tools

Basic OpenStreetMap training can take as few as two days. This is a typical amount of time to work through the beginner training material available on <b>[learnosm.org](http://learnosm.org/)</b>. However, learning OSM in depth requires time and plenty of practice. Training should include both classroom time to work through the software step by step and multiple field excursions.

While training core staff, it is a good idea to dedicate at least one week and sometimes two simply to mapping and training. That way, the staff will have plenty of supervised practice before they supervise others. This training period can also overlap with project preparation. Even after training is complete and mappers are doing their job, take care to watch for mistakes and help the mappers continue to learn.

A typical OSM training outline includes the following:

<div class="c-list">
  <ol>
    <b>Desktop Mapping</b>
    <br><br>
    <li>Introduction to OpenStreetMap and signing up for an account</li>
    <li>Using OSM’s online editor, iD
      <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>Understanding OSM concepts such as nodes, ways, and tags</li>
       	<li>Using aerial imagery to edit</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Using the OSM Tasking Manager for Project management</li>
    <li>Using the offline editing software, JOSM</li>
    <br>
    <b>Mapping in the field</b>
    <br><br>
    <li>Creating and using Field Papers to map (this also requires training on the full workflow, on how to take the data from Field Papers, and re-enter it in OSM)</li>
    <li>Using a GPS device to map</li>
    <li>Using Mobile applications to map in OSM</li>
    <li>Using Mobile devices to collect and/or upplement map data</li>
  </ol>
</div>

These are the main areas to cover when training beginners for active participation in a mapping project, but the list can be expanded or shortened, depending on the training needs.

### 3.3.2 Training on Surveying

The second training component concerns your project’s specific data model and how to collect accurate attributes in the field.

<div class="c-box">
  <span class="box-title"><b>Box 3.1 Data Model</b></span>
  <p>Simply, a data model refers to a schema or list of all the mappable objects that you wish to collect information about, and the specific pieces of information (variables/labels or tags) you wish to record about those objects. A well designed data model should have a very specific list of predefined variables/labels or tags for each type of object. This allows us to classify and quantify the data that we collect, as well as symbolize it in a consistent way.</p>
  <p>Once a data model has been designed for a project, a survey can be created around it to capture the data in the field.
  For example, in the pilot project in Dhaka, structural attributes about individual buildings were collected, such as the type of structure and whether the buildings had vertical irregularity. As most surveyors were not engineers, this training required several days, which included practice identifying buildings in the field.</p>
  <p>The amount of training time that should be dedicated to this component depends on the complexity of your data model and the background of the mappers. For example, not much instruction is required to collect only street names and surface types. But if you are collecting detailed structural attributes of buildings, mappers will likely need to learn some engineering basics in order to identify various attributes. They will also need precise definitions of those attributes. For example, if one of the attributes you are collecting is the building’s condition, and the possible values are “poor,” “average,” and “fair,” you will need a precise description of each of these subjective terms.</p>
</div>

It is a good idea to develop a survey training manual for mappers that includes clear descriptions of the various attributes you are collecting along with photographs, they they can take to the field for reference purposes. In the Open Cities Dhaka project, for example, the survey required detailed engineering knowledge. The team’s training manual clearly showed the differences between types of masonry, for example. It was also particularly valuable to differentiate subjective attributes, such whether a building’s physical condition was “poor,” “average,” or “good.” Mappers had clear definitions for each so they could accurately and uniformly identify those values in the field.

All said, a week of training is probably more than adequate for most projects, and this can be combined with actual mapping activities that managers lead or supervise. The more experience mappers have, the better they will do, but they will need ongoing guidance as they learn how to map properly.
