## Appendix 1 Data Model Design

Your data model is a chart of the features and attributes
of those features that you plan to collect in the field. As
described in chapter 3, designing the data model is a
process of determining the priorities of your project in
coordination with your partners.
After a data model has been defined, you must determine
how the features will be mapped using the Open-
StreetMap tagging system. In OSM, features are drawn
as points, lines, or polygons, and tags are applied to these
features to describe their attributes. Common tags can
be seen on the OSM Wiki site, at <b><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features/" target="_blank">wiki.openstreetmap.
org/wiki/Map_Features</a></b>.

OpenStreetMap uses a free-tagging system. That is, you
can use any tags that you want to describe attributes.
However, it is important that users around the world agree on the same tagging conventions to represent
features in order to maintain data uniformity. For
example, this is why nearly all tags are in the English
language. For most attributes that you want to map, you
can probably find an existing tagging convention on the
OSM Wiki site. Also useful is <b><a href="http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">taginfo.openstreetmap.
org</a></b>, which provides statistics about tags that are being
used in the OSM database. In some cases when you are
mapping new features or attributes, it may be necessary
to invent new OSM tags. It is a good idea to discuss this
with your local e-mail list and by sending a message to
<b>tagging@openstreetmap.org</b>.

The data model below (figure A6.1.1), designed for the
Open Cities Dhaka pilot project, shows how attributes
were mapped as OpenStreetMap tags.

## Appendix 4 Sample Project Report

It is a good idea to provide snapshot progress reports every two to four weeks during a mapping project.
These can be brief, 1- to 2-page documents that highlight any news or changes in project design,
mapping progress, and metrics on data collection and quality control. The sample below suggests content
to include.

### Open Cities Project Update - July 1, 2014
I. Project Updates
A brief paragraph summarizing new project developments. For example, any unexpected changes in
the project, either positive or negative, may be recorded here. In other words, any project news, such as
meetings with key partners, mapping activities, and adjustments to the project design.
<p><div class="c-list">
    <ul>
        <li>bullet points</li>
        <li>are good</li>
        <li>for document progress</li>
        <li>simply</li>
    </ul>
</div></p>

II. Mapping Progress
A simple map produced in GIS software can give a quick visual explanation of your progress.
