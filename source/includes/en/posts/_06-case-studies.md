## Batticaloa, Sri Lanka

### Overview

Batticaloa, a major city in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province severely affected by the Sri Lankan civil war and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, is located in a hazard-prone area that has suffered near-annual droughts, floods and cyclones. Some limited hazard maps were available for the area, but no detailed digital geographic data of the built environment were available for use in risk studies or for informing contingency and response planning, potential infrastructure and risk mitigation projects.

### Scope of Work

The objective of the Open Cities project was to map the complete building stock including critical assets and road infrastructures of the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat, which covers an area of 68 km2 and includes about 90,000 people around the town of Batticaloa. The characteristics collected focused on basic information necessary for vulnerability assessment including number of floors, usage, and construction materials of walls and roof.

###Partners

<b>National Government</b> — Several national government agencies including the Disaster Management Center, the Survey Department and the Census Department were involved from the beginning in the design of the project. Along the course of the project, the key national agency were updated on the progress and results of work. These partnerships provided the OpenCities with a strong country ownership, an important credibility, and a legitimacy to interact with the local government. The national agencies also provided staff from the local offices to support the project and build their capacity.

<b>Local Government</b> — Locally, the work began with a series of meetings with the Batticaloa local authorities. In part, these were designed to establish the close collaboration needed to carry out the actual mapping. They were also meant to ensure local understanding of and trust in the mapping process and in the data produced, so as to encourage local authorities to use the tools and data for their own DRM and urban planning projects.

<b>Humanitarian OpenstreetMap Team (HOT)</b> — HOT provided some remote support to the team and facilitated a national workshop on OpenStreetMap at the end of the project to spread the word about OSM and build the capacity of key national agencies in order to start scaling up the project in Sri Lanka.

<b>Universities</b> — The project was presented to most of the professors of the key departments in the main Sri Lankan universities (University of Colombo, University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Eastern University). Some of the professors participated in the national OSM workshop held by HOT. A small amount of mapping parties were held however as the location of Batticaloa is very far from most universities, the students were not involved directly in the data collection for this phase but will be involved in the next phase of the project.

### Building the Team

A team of four technical experts (three recent GIS and IT graduates and one experienced GIS analyst) was hired and trained in OpenStreetMap techniques in order to supervise and support the overall mapping process. The team was completed by the staff from local partners, including the Batticaloa Municipal Council, the Batticaloa District, the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat to constitute a team of about a dozen person fluent in OSM. For the field survey, the core team worked with the 48 recent university graduates that had been recently hired to work on the local planning and development of the 48 Grama Niladhari that make up the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat. The graduates were appointed by the District Commissioner to work on the Open Cities project and received a stipend for the extra work.

### Workspace

It was initially planned to host the team in the Manmunai North Divisional Secretariat premises but due to space, time and connectivity constraints, the team rented a house in Batticaloa that was used as a headquarter. It was set up with computers, internet connection, printers, tables, bedrooms in order to provide a space for trainings and to process field data.

### Existing Map Resources

The team found an existing dataset for building footprints on the eastern coast. However, after examination, the quality was poor as it had been generated by automatic extraction so it was decided not to use it. Some datasets existed for infrastructures like schools and roads but they were not cleared for use in OSM and outdated. Therefore, no pre-existing digital data was used in the project. However, the team worked with Divisional Secretariat and each GN divisions as they maintained paper maps for each of the 48 GN divisions. A booklet with all the paper maps were shared with the team and used to add landmarks and street names to the initial base map.

### Data Collection

A small group began by tracing all building outlines into OSM using satellite imagery and then added landmarks, roads and road names, and points of interests using local paper maps provided by the divisional secretariat. This effort created a solid reference map for the surveying work. The work was then split into two components: buildings were surveyed by the 48 recent graduates, and surveyed data were entered by the core team who were also responsible for fixing the maps and refining the point of interests. Both groups were trained in OSM and surveying techniques by the Open Cities team.

### Quality Control

Several measures were taken to ensure the data quality and ownership. First, the team worked with the local Building department, the Batticaloa Municipal Council civil engineer, and a civil engineering professor from the University of Moratuwa to create the building survey and ensure that it is usable by non-expert and taking into account local building practices. Second, the local team did ongoing quality assessment by doing a re-surveying of a sample of buildings for each GN divisions, making sure that the surveyors were not making mistakes. If some errors were found, corrective actions would be taken right away to ensure the rest of the data would be correct. Third, the team ran queries on the database to identify anomalies in the data collected and accordingly made fixes and took corrective actions through extra training. The trust and ownership in the data was ensured by the multiple partnerships with the national and local government and engaging through regular updates and feedback loops through the different phases of the project.

### Results

Footprints and basic characteristics including number of floors, usage, and construction materials of walls and roof was collected for all 30,000 buildings in the area. These data are now freely available in OpenStreetMap and in the government geospatial data sharing platform RiskInfo (www.riskinfo.lk) for easy use by many stakeholders. At the local level, a wrap-up ceremony was held with all the stakeholders and participants where A3 maps were given to each GN division and T-shirt were handed out to all the participants. Future plans were also discussed including the request to extend the project to other DS Divisions in the district and to link the household survey recently conducted (150 questions per household) with the geographic data. To publicize the benefits of these techniques at the national level and promote their adoption, high-level managers of the relevant national agencies were briefed regularly and given final results when available. Two week-long training courses, one dealing with OSM techniques and the other with use of data for decision making (specifically the combination of data with existing hazard maps through GIS tools and the InaSAFE tool) were conducted at the national level with all relevant national agencies. Discussions are ongoing with various ministries concerning the next phase of the project. A second phase of the project will take place to cover the flood prone Attanagalu Oya river basin near Colombo. There is also strong interest in scaling up the project to cover a greater geographic area, in using OSM to update the Survey Department data, and in streamlining the use of the data in more DRM applications and sectors.

## Kathmandu, Nepal

### Overview

Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, is the most seismically at risk city in the world in terms of potential for loss of human life during a major event. In November 2012, in partnership with the government of Nepal, the World Bank and GFDRR launched a project to build seismic resilience in the Kathmandu Valley’s education and health infrastructure, in part by creating a disaster risk model to determine the relative vulnerability of the relevant buildings. Once complete, the model will be used to prioritize plans for retrofits of schools and health facilities to improve structural integrity in the face of earthquake.

### Scope of Work

The mapping goal for Open Cities Kathmandu was to collect data on location, occupancy, and structural characteristics for all of the schools and health facilities in the Kathmandu Valley.

### Partners

<b>Government</b> — The Nepal Department of Education is a key partner in Open Cities Kathmandu. They are leading the risk assessment project to which the mapping work will contribute. In addition to institutional support, the DOE also provided a letter of support that mappers carried with them as part of the work, instrumental to gaining access to some of the facilities.

<b>Technical Agencies</b> — NSET, the National Society for Earthquake Technology, is a Kathmandu-based NGO with significant seismic risk and engineering expertise. They supported the project through assistance with data modelling, providing training on structural assessments to the mapping team, and conducting quality assessment of the data throughout the process.

<b>Universities</b> — Universities were critical partners in the project. Connections to the Geomatics and Engineering departments in Kathmandu University and Tribhuvan University assisted with finding the core team and volunteers for the project and helped provide technical guidance and quality control during key project phases.

### Building the Team

The core team comprised six graduates of Kathmandu University who were recruited based on their prior contribution to Nepal’s then-nascent OSM community. They were paid full-time salaries at rates commensurate with the local salary structure for recent graduates in technical disciplines. The project also recruited six part-time interns from Kathmandu University and 11 volunteers from Tribhuvan University.

### Workspace

The project identified a local co-working space and technology startup incubator that provided access to meeting rooms, reliable Internet service, and opportunities to interact with other technologists and entrepreneurs, some of whom later became active in the local OpenStreetMap community as a result of the team’s outreach efforts.

### Existing Map Resources

The mapping team obtained a spreadsheet containing an incomplete list of 1701 schools in the Kathmandu Valley from the Department of Education (DOE), which was then used as a starting point for the survey. The list did not provide the exact location of schools, just the wards in which they were located. For health facilities, Open Cities Kathmandu used three sources to generate a reference list of hospitals, health posts, and polyclinics: a list of 100 private and community hospitals received unofficially from the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), a list of 205 medical centers approved by MOHP that is accessible through the official website of the MOHP, and the names of 70 hospitals and 27 polyclinics from a private-sector health organization in Kathmandu. Together, these provided a list of over 400 unique health service providers that the team worked to locate and survey using a similar approach.

### Data Collection

The mapping teams used a snowball approach to find locations of the schools. They began with what location data were available through other sources, or by using their personal knowledge and social networks. They then talked with locals, school officials and health facilities personnel to locate remaining schools as well as ascertain the existence of schools not on their list. As a result of requests from school officials, the team also began carrying and distributing pamphlets and posters that provided basic information on earthquake preparedness and safety.

### Quality Control

The team took a number of steps to ensure that data collected during the project were accurate and that they would be trusted by the wider group of stakeholders involved in disaster risk reduction in Nepal. First, the project was carried out with explicit support of Nepal’s Department of Education and the World Bank, two institutions with credible reputations in the country. Second, the team consulted frequently on engineering matters with The National Society for Earthquake Technologies (NSET), a well-recognized entity in disaster community in Nepal. NSET Engineers helped design the survey and provided training. The project also provided OSM training to a wide range of individuals from government, donor, and NGO community to build awareness of and comfort with the platform and approach. Finally, NSET conducted quality assessment of OSM data regularly during the surveying process.

Through the involvement of NSET in Open Cities Kathmandu, the team regularly made quality assessments of the survey to both identify problems as they occurred and also to be able to assess the data collected in full at the project’s completion. Of particular concern was the building structure surveying, which required training from NSET for the mapping team and volunteers to survey correctly. The first field verification was performed immediately after the first training and some initial in-field practice. The accuracy of the data for building structural system was 50% during this period. Given this result, NSET provided a “refreshers” training to the surveyors. Following this second training, the accuracy of the structural data increased collected by the mappers rose to 100%.

### Results

Open Cities Kathmandu surveyed 2,256 schools and 350 health facilities in the Kathmandu Valley. In addition to collecting a comprehensive list of structural data for health and school facilities, the team worked to create a comprehensive base map of the valley by digitizing building footprints, mapping the road network, and collecting information on other major points of interest. The Open Cities team also conducted significant outreach to universities, technical communities, and government in order to expand the OSM community. Over 2,300 individuals participated in OSM trainings or presentations during the first year of the project. The data have been used in plans to retrofit school and health facilities and in applications for transportation planning; moreover, USAID has incorporated the data into disaster preparedness planning exercises. That the American Red Cross has begun to contribute to OpenStreetMap in Kathmandu suggests that development partners remain interested in the project. A local NGO called the Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL), staffed by participants in the first phase of the Open Cities project, has been created in order to continue the work. KLL has recently received funding from ICIMOD, a local technical organization, and the US Embassy in order to conduct OSM trainings and mapping activities.

## Dhaka, Bangladesh

### Overview

Dhaka’s Old City is a crowded and complex area of immense historical value and an important locus of social and economic activity. In consultation with Dhaka Water and Sanitation, seismic risk experts from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), and the Urban Study Group, a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) working on heritage preservation and restoration in Old Dhaka, the Dhaka Open Cities pilot sought to create detailed maps of three of the Old City’s 15 wards. These maps would provide data useful for planning of evacuation routes, managing water and sanitation infrastructure, and understanding the location and characteristics of heritage buildings.

### Partners

<b>Dhaka Water and Sanitation Department</b> — Dhaka WASA was the primary government partner for this project and provided initial data describing water and sanitation infrastructure in Old Dhaka as well as input into the data modelling process.

<b>Urban Study Group</b> — The Urban Study Group provided data on location of critical heritage sites in Old Dhaka as well as input into the data modelling process.

<b>The Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS)</b> — CEGIS is a local NGO with extensive experience working on GIS and surveying in Bangladesh. They provided overall management of the mapping work and quality assessment of the data collected.

<b>Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)</b> — HOT provided initial OSM training to project participants and assisted with the development of reporting and project tracking processes.

### Building the Team

In partnership with BUET, which provided technical support and a working space, 20 engineering and planning undergraduates were hired as mappers and were trained for a three-month period. A local nonprofit GIS consulting organization, CEGIS, was contracted with to provide management and quality control for the work. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, a nonprofit specializing in the use of OpenStreetMap in development and humanitarian relief situations, also provided training and technical oversight to the project.

### Workspace

BUET University provided a computer lab to serve as the primary workspace for training of project participants and data entry work.

### Existing Map Resources

The effort began by importing building footprint data for the three wards—created by CEGIS as part of a different project but until that point unavailable to the public—directly into OpenStreetMap. This allowed the mapping team to focus on field surveying, in which basic characteristics, such as building height, usage, construction materials, and age were collected through visual survey of each building.

### Data Collection

Mapping teams divided the three wards into so-called blocks - sections which were bounded by roads on all sides. Each day a team would be assigned one or more of these blocks to survey, more easily mapping the densely set buildings due to the small compartmentalized blocks which they were sent to map. Imagery was less useful than normal due to the building density, but this methodology helped ensure accurate data collection.

They also mapped road characteristics (width and surface type) along with important water and sanitation infrastructure. The data were added to OpenStreetMap during times when conditions prohibited field surveys (e.g., poor weather conditions, strikes).


### Quality Control

The mappers were divided into small groups of surveying teams, each led by a team leader, who was responsible for organizing and planning their team’s work and ensuring smooth and accurate data entry. The team leaders were also responsible for implementing quality control measures. Twice each month they would randomly select ten percent of their mappers’ buildings and resurvey them. By doing so they could calculate the likely percentage of error of the entire survey, correct a limited number of mistakes, and discover repeated mistakes in the surveyors’ workflow.

### Results

During this period, the team was able to finish complete maps of the three wards. In total, 8,500 buildings, 540 of which were deemed to have historical significance, were surveyed. Sections of roads measuring 43km and drainage works measuring over 50km were also assessed. These data are now available to the public through the OpenStreetMap platform. Several training courses and presentations on OpenStreet- Map were also given to university students, government partners, and private sector technology companies during the project period in order to help the OSM community in Dhaka grow. The results of the pilot were presented to the government and other key stakeholders in December 2013. Consultations are ongoing concerning the next phase of the project.
